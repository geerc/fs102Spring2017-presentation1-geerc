##How Your GPS Effects Your Brain

This repository contains the HTML source code and additional resources for a presentation by Christian Geer about GPS navigation. The presentation's source code uses the reveal.js framework to control the display of each slide. You can find the presentation [here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/geerc/fs102Spring2017-presentation1-geerc/a5447628/quiqleytownhall_presentation.html)

You are welcome to use these slides as inspiration for your own presentation.
Installation Instructions

You can type the following command if you want to clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/gkapfham/seke2015-panel-presentation.git

Please note that the presentation uses local fonts so that it can be displayed at a conference on a laptop that either may not have access to the Internet or may only have unreliable Internet access. Some browsers may disallow the loading of local fonts due to security reasons. However, it should be possible for you to view the presentation correctly when using Chrome or Chromium on the Ubuntu operating system â€” this is my primary development environment and the one that I used to give the presentation. However, I anticipate that the presentation slides should display correctly on a wide variety of operating systems and browsers.

I have found that some versions of Chrome and Chromium do not quickly load the full-screen images that I use as backgrounds. If you notice this problem as well, then I would encourage you to "serve" the presentation with a local Web server, such as the Ruby-based one available at jlong/serve. If you adopt this approach, then you should type the following command:

serve 4100

Now, you can navigate to the Web site http://localhost:4100/seke2015_panel.html and view the presentation. Ultimately, if you are unable to get the presentation to display correctly in your own web browser, then please open a new issue and I will attempt to resolve your concerns.
